Gemma-2-2b-it Abliterated trained on 400 examples of synthetic incantations. 
Experimental, not great output quality.
will randomly select to rhyme (or not) or produce output in latin. 
prompt example: "Write an incantation to cause [?]" 

WARNINGS:
Based on an abliterated 2 billion parameter model, will pretty much say anything, very "yes and" and quite dumb. 
Not recommended for use, but is funny, and might be good for D&D or writing or something. 
No warranty expressed or implied, definitely not recommended for children.
